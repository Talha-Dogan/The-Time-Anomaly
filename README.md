# The-Time-Anomaly


Time Anomaly invites players to witness time travel from its most primitive perspective — through the eyes of a caveman. The story begins on a silent prehistoric night, when a mysterious meteor tears through the sky and crashes into the valley. Inside it lies a strange crystal pulsating with unknown energy. The moment our caveman touches it, he triggers a chain reaction powerful enough to ripple through all of time.

In an instant, he is engulfed by a blinding light and thrown across eras he never knew existed. One moment he may find himself stranded on frozen continents ruled by glaciers, and in the next, he may awaken in the middle of a futuristic city filled with advanced robotics. With each jump, the balance of time fractures a little more, and players must struggle both to survive and to uncover the truth behind these chaotic distortions.

Time Anomaly blends enemies, environmental puzzles, and dynamic combat systems from various eras into one fluid experience. Each period presents unique dangers, cultures, and landscapes to explore. Players will use everything from primitive Stone Age tools to high-tech futuristic gear as they navigate their way through ever-shifting timelines. But the greatest threat isn’t the creatures or the environments — it’s time itself. Every choice you make affects future events, changing the worlds you’ll encounter later in the game.

Balancing fast-paced action with atmospheric exploration, the game delivers an immersive time-travel adventure. As the caveman fights to survive and unravel the mystery of the crystal, he unknowingly steps into a journey that will reshape the fate of the universe. Time Anomaly is an epic voyage through shattered timelines — one where you’ll discover who you truly are as time collapses around you.
